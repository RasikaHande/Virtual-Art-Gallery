      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Rasika Hande</strong> — the creator of <strong>ArtSpace</strong>, a virtual modern art gallery that blends technology with creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This project is a creative digital space built with React.js and CSS, designed to provide a smooth, responsive, and immersive experience of modern art. It allows users to explore abstract expressions, bold visuals, and the emotional depth of contemporary design in a virtual gallery format.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal with this gallery is to let people explore bold, expressive artworks in a clean and interactive way — no logins, no distractions, just pure visual enjoyment.
      </p>
